Tower Defence Game

Use the mouse pointer to direct through menu and level selector.

Within the game:
W, A, S and D will move the camera in every direction allowing to scroll over all areas of the map
to be able to place towers.
Using the mouse towards the edge of the screen on all sides has the same effect as WASD.
Using the scroll wheel allows the user to zoom in and out for a closer view of the what is happening.

Clicking Esc or P will pause the game and give three options, to Continue, Retry or Menu.
Menu will go back to the main menu which then either has two buttons to quit or select a level.
Retry will restart the current level.

Clicking on the Icons then hovering over a node while green will allow the player to place a turret on that node.
If it is red, means not enough money is available for the turret to be placed.
When a turret is placed, the player can then select the node that has a turret on it to bring up some UI to show
two options to either upgrade or sell the turret. Each turret can only be upgraded once and has different prices 
attached to each one.

If the player loses a game over screen appears and they can then retry or click menu.

If the player wins a round win screen appears and they can continue or click menu.
